## Overview
This was a team project to build a full-stack web application over the course of one week. The website was developed by four individuals remotely using Zoom, Slack, Trello, Git, Figma wireframe, and Github for collaboration.
<br>
<br>
MonkeyWrench is a contractor/customer based maintenance portal where many contractors can connect with many customers to create and respond to service requests. A contractor may establish one or many businesses within their profile and can view their entire client list or search/sort by name, address, service request, and more. Contractors can view requests by day, week, month, and all in accordance with the current date and time to ensure optimal ease of use through our front-end UI. A customer may establish multiple addresses for service requests and use multiple contractors at once. Service requests can be commented on by both customers and contractors to ensure clear and concise communication regarding projects.

## Lessons Learned
- **Organize a fully fleshed out plan that all members of the team can envision and follow**
<br>
We set a good foundation for our portal design with our wireframe, however, it is important to very specifically iterate over each design feature to ensure every member of the team is on the same page and can work toward the same goal. We soon realized that what we thought was common understanding was easily being misunderstood which led to debates in design philosophy down the road which could have been avoided. Although not a major setback, it did slow our process down when we had to stop and all come to an understanding about what we were trying to achieve and how we could implement it.
<br>
<br>

- **Angular Quirks**
<br>
We learned some of the intricacies of angular front-end design which led to quite a few head-scratchers. One such example is the conflicting dynamic between a select and an ngModel. Our emphasis on the use of pipes expanded the functionality of our base code allowing for more dynamic front-end data manipulation.
<br>
<br>

- **Git branches**
<br>
Git branches and pull requests were used to great affect. They significantly improved our flexibility to work as a team and avoid any possible conflicts on merge.
<br>
<br>

- **Working as a team**
<br>
The most significant step in our education with this project was a larger team effort for us. As each day passed our team cohesiveness grew very quickly and we were able to more readily implement, design, and augment features on our platform. This is because we began to understand each other's approach to code and we could more clearly communicate our own ideas. We also became more adept at thinking around problems. If a problem proved to be substantially difficult to overcome, we would often come up with a solution for the same issue through a different approach. This significantly sped up our production schedule.

## What Could've Been Done Better
- As discussed above, a better more uniform approach to actually coding/naming conventions would be ideal.
- The CSS and styling also needs more in-depth work to truly create a professional feel.

## Future Implementations
- UI cleanup
- UX Design streamlining
- Service Request approval
- On-site equipment implementation
